My new readme.

This file is mandatory

A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:

adding a feature in development
collaborating on the same project with other developers
not breaking your entire repository
not upsetting your co-workers
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.
Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time…
As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.
Your goal now is to resolve merge conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.
At the end, you should have all your work from the branch update_script (new file and two updated files) and all latest main commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.
gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.
